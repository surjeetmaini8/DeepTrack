# DeepTrack
Face Recognition Attendance System is a Python-based solution that automates attendance tracking using deep learning and facial recognition. It captures face images of students, extracts facial embeddings using the DeepFace library and Facenet, trains a neural network model for identity recognition, and logs attendance in real-time using a webcam.
